## Intuition Protocol Core Concepts

### Atom
The **fundamental unit** of information in the Intuition knowledge graph. An atom represents a discrete entity, concept, or idea that can be referenced and combined to form triples.

**Types of Atoms:**
- **Person Atom**: Represents an individual (e.g., "Vitalik Buterin")
- **Organization Atom**: Represents a company, DAO, or institution
- **Thing Atom**: Generic object or concept
- **Account Atom**: Represents a blockchain address
- **Predicate Atom**: Special atom defining relationships (e.g., "is", "trusts", "owns")

**On-chain Properties:**
- `term_id`: Unique on-chain identifier
- `data`: IPFS hash, URL, or direct data pointer
- `creator_id`: Address that created the atom
- `vault_id`: Associated vault for staking

---

### Triple
A **semantic statement** connecting three atoms in Subject-Predicate-Object structure. Triples express claims or relationships in the knowledge graph.

**Structure:**
```
[Subject Atom] → [Predicate Atom] → [Object Atom]
"Ethereum"     → "is"             → "decentralized"
```

**Key Properties:**
- Has TWO vaults (Support Vault and Counter Vault)
- Can be staked FOR (support) or AGAINST (dispute)
- Creates a natural prediction market for truth

---

### Knowledge Graph
The **interconnected network** of atoms and triples that forms Intuition's decentralized database of information. Unlike traditional databases, the knowledge graph:
- Is permissionless (anyone can add data)
- Is economically weighted (stakes indicate importance)
- Is semantically structured (RDF-like relationships)

---

### Claim
Synonym for **Triple**. A statement asserting a relationship between entities. Claims are neither automatically true nor false—their validity is determined by community staking.

---

### Counter-Triple
The **negation** of a triple. Every triple automatically has a counter-triple representing the opposite claim. Staking on the counter-triple means you dispute the original claim.

---

### Identity
In Intuition context, refers to an **Atom representing a person, organization, or account**. Identities can accumulate reputation through associated triples and stakes.

---

## Economic & Tokenomics Terms

### TRUST
The **native ERC-20 governance and utility token** of the Intuition network. Used for:
- Creating atoms and triples (creation fees)
- Staking on claims (economic signaling)
- Governance voting
- Node operator bonding

**Note:** On testnet, the token is called **tTRUST** (test TRUST).

---

### Vault
An **economic container** that holds staked funds for an atom or triple. Vaults:
- Issue shares to stakers based on bonding curves
- Track Total Value Locked (TVL)
- Manage entry and exit fees
- Distribute fees to existing shareholders

**Vault Types:**
- **Atom Vault**: Single vault per atom
- **Support Vault**: For stakes supporting a triple
- **Counter Vault**: For stakes opposing a triple

---

### Staking
The act of **depositing tokens** into a vault to signal belief or conviction. Staking:
- Adds economic weight to information
- Earns rewards from entry fees paid by later stakers
- Influences visibility and ranking
- Builds on-chain reputation

---

### Shares
**Units of ownership** in a vault. When you stake, you receive shares proportional to your deposit and the current share price. Shares:
- Represent your claim to the vault's assets
- Can be redeemed for underlying tokens (minus exit fees)
- Price is determined by the bonding curve

---

### Bonding Curve
A **mathematical function** that determines share prices based on supply. As more people stake, the price increases.

**Curve Types:**
| Type | Formula | Characteristics |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Linear** | P = mx + b | Steady, predictable |
| **Exponential/Quadratic** | P = ax² | Rewards early stakers heavily |
| **Sigmoid** | P = L/(1+e^(-k(x-x₀))) | S-curve with plateau |

---

### Entry Fee
Fee paid **when depositing** into a vault. Distributed pro-rata to existing shareholders. Incentivizes early staking.

---

### Exit Fee
Fee paid **when redeeming** shares from a vault. Distributed to remaining shareholders. Discourages rapid speculation.

---

### Protocol Fee
A percentage of fees that goes to the **Intuition protocol treasury** for development and operations.

---

### TVL (Total Value Locked)
The **total amount of tokens** staked in a vault or across the entire protocol.

---

### Share Price
The **current cost** to acquire one share in a vault. Determined by the bonding curve formula based on total shares outstanding.

---

### Market Cap
For vaults: `Total Shares × Current Share Price`. Indicates the total economic weight behind an atom or triple.

---

### Position
A user's **staking record** in a specific vault, including:
- Number of shares owned
- Total assets deposited
- Unrealized gains/losses

---

### Signal
An **economic action** (deposit or redemption) that indicates sentiment. Signals are tracked as events and contribute to trend analysis.

---

### Relative Strength
A metric indicating **how strong** a signal is relative to the vault's total activity. High relative strength = significant conviction.

---

### veTRUST (Vote-Escrowed TRUST)
TRUST tokens **locked for a period** in exchange for:
- Boosted voting power
- Higher reward multipliers
- Governance participation rights

Inspired by Curve's veTokenomics model.

---

### Emissions
**New tokens distributed** over time as rewards. Intuition uses a decaying emission schedule that front-loads rewards to early participants.

---

### System Utilization
A protocol-level metric measuring **overall network usage**. Affects emission rates—if utilization is low, emissions slow down to prevent inflation without value creation.

---

### Personal Utilization
An individual user's **activity level** that affects their reward eligibility. Active curators earn more than passive stakers.

---

## Technical Infrastructure

### MultiVault
The **main smart contract** that manages all vaults, atoms, and triples. Single contract architecture for gas efficiency.

---

### Hasura

---

### Indexer
A service (written in Rust in `intuition-rs`) that **reads blockchain events** and stores structured data in a database for efficient querying.

---

### Consumer
A component in `intuition-rs` that **processes events** from the blockchain. Types:
- **Raw Consumer**: Processes raw blockchain events
- **Decoded Consumer**: Interprets event data
- **Resolver**: Enriches data with metadata

---

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
A **distributed storage network** used to store atom metadata (JSON-LD documents, images). Atoms reference IPFS via `ipfs://` URIs.

---

### IPFS Gateway

---

### Pinata

---

### GraphQL
