# Hive Mind Snap

A MetaMask Snap that displays real-time trust and reputation data from the [Intuition](https://intuition.systems) knowledge graph during transaction signing.

## What Does This Snap Do?

When you're about to send a transaction to an address, the Hive Mind Snap shows you:

- **Trust Signals** — How many people have staked that the address is trustworthy (or not)
- **Aliases** — Community-assigned labels for the address
- **Stake Amounts** — The economic weight behind each trust signal
- **Your Position** — Your own trust/distrust stake displayed prominently as the strongest signal
- **dApp Origin Trust** — Trust data for the dApp you're interacting with
- **Your Trust Circle** — See which of your trusted contacts have staked on this address (sorted by stake)

This helps you make informed decisions before interacting with unknown addresses or dApps.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Transaction Insights** | `onTransaction` hook displays trust data before you sign |
| **Your Position** | Prominently displays your own trust/distrust stake as the strongest signal |
| **Trust Triple Display** | Shows support/oppose positions on `[address] has tag trustworthy` |
| **dApp Origin Trust** | Shows trust data for the dApp origin (transaction source) |
| **Your Trust Circle** | Highlights when your trusted contacts have staked on an address (sorted by stake) |
| **Distribution Analysis** | Analyzes stake distribution health (concentrated vs. distributed) |
| **Alias Display** | Shows community-assigned aliases for addresses |
| **Multi-chain Support** | Works on Intuition Testnet (chain ID: 13579) and Mainnet (chain ID: 1155) |
| **Interactive UI** | Links to create trust signals or view more data on the web |
| **Persistent Cache** | Trust circle cached for 1 hour for optimal performance |

## Installation

### From npm (once published)

```bash
# The snap will be installable directly through MetaMask
# Package name: @hivemindhq/snap
```

### For Development

See the [Development](#development) section below.

## Permissions

This Snap requires the following permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `endowment:transaction-insight` | Display insights before transaction signing |
| `endowment:page-home` | Custom home page in MetaMask |
| `endowment:network-access` | Query the Intuition GraphQL API |
| `endowment:rpc` | Communicate with dapps |
| `snap_manageState` | Cache trusted circle data for performance |

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [MetaMask Flask](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask) (development version of MetaMask)
- Node.js ≥ 18.6.0
- Yarn

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hivemindhq-io/snap.git
   cd intuition-snap
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:8000` and connect the Snap to MetaMask Flask

### Chain Configuration

By default, the Snap connects to **Intuition Testnet**. To use mainnet:

```bash
yarn start:mainnet
```

Or explicitly specify testnet:

```bash
yarn start:testnet
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Run the test suite:

```bash
yarn test
```

Tests use [`@metamask/snaps-jest`](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/tree/main/packages/snaps-jest) for Snap-specific testing utilities.

**What's tested:**
- `onHomePage` handler — Renders correctly with expected content
- `Account.tsx` components — All UI rendering variations (26 tests)

### Manual E2E Testing

The `onTransaction` handler requires network access to the Intuition GraphQL API. Because `@metamask/snaps-jest` runs the Snap in an isolated worker process, network requests cannot be mocked from the test process.

**To test transaction insights:**

1. Start the development server: `yarn start`
2. Open http://localhost:8000 in a browser with MetaMask Flask
3. Install the Snap
4. Initiate a transaction on Intuition Testnet/Mainnet
5. Verify trust data displays correctly in the transaction confirmation

## Configuration

Chain settings are defined in `src/config.ts`:

| Network | Chain ID | RPC URL | Currency |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|
| Testnet | 13579 | `https://testnet.rpc.intuition.systems` | tTRUST |
| Mainnet | 1155 | `https://rpc.intuition.systems` | TRUST |

### Atoms Used

The Snap queries the Intuition knowledge graph using these predefined atoms:

| Atom | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `hasTag` | Predicate for trust triples |
| `trustworthy` | The "trustworthy" characteristic |
| `hasAlias` | Predicate for alias relationships |
